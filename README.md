# ev3paster
A python script made to combine 2 .lmsp files (ev3 projects) together

Run the script like this:
    `$ python3 paster.py <path to project 1> <path to project 2>`

Exemple:
    `$ python3 paster.py ~/Documents/LEGO Education EV3/FollowLine.lmsp ~/Documents/LEGO Education EV3/TurnGyro.lmsp`

All the blocks from both programms will be merged (+ variables, lists, broadcasts, comments, etc...)

**Please always make a backup before using this, as ev3 education app doesn't really like doing this**
